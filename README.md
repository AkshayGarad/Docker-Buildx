# Using Docker Buildx to Create Cross-Platform Docker Images for Seamless Compatibility

Docker has revolutionized the world of containerization, providing a convenient and efficient way to package and deploy applications. However, until recently, I mistakenly believed that Docker images were inherently portable and could seamlessly run on any machine, regardless of the underlying CPU architecture. That misconception became apparent when a colleague shared an image built on their Mac, and I attempted to run it on my Ubuntu machine, only to encounter compatibility issues.

The problem stemmed from the fact that Macs use ARM processors, while my machine was equipped with an AMD processor. As a result, when I tried to run the container, I received a warning message stating, "WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64) and no specific platform was requested." Consequently, the container would abruptly terminate, leaving me perplexed.

Thankfully, my quest to find a solution led me to discover an incredible tool called Docker Buildx. This command-line tool extends the capabilities of the regular `docker build` command, enabling the creation and management of multi-platform Docker images. With Docker Buildx, we can build Docker images that are compatible with various CPU architectures, such as AMD64 and ARM64, to ensure seamless execution across different platforms.

Let's take a closer look at how we can leverage Docker Buildx to create cross-platform Docker images:

## Setting up the Builder Instance

Before we can utilize Docker Buildx, we need to set up a builder instance. This can be accomplished by running the following command:

```bash
$ docker buildx create --use --name buildx_instance
```

This command creates a new builder instance named `buildx_instance` and makes it active for use.

To verify the status of the builder instance, we can use either the `docker buildx ls` or `docker ps` command. The former provides detailed information about the builder instances, while the latter displays the running containers associated with the builder instance.

```bash
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE          DRIVER/ENDPOINT             STATUS  BUILDKIT PLATFORMS
buildx_instance *  docker-container                             
  buildx_instance0 unix:///var/run/docker.sock running v0.11.6  linux/amd64, linux/amd64/v2, linux/amd64/v3, linux/386
default            docker                                       
  default          default                     running 20.10.22 linux/amd64, linux/386

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
e023022a7b0e   moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1   "buildkitd"   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes             buildx_buildkit_buildx_instance0
```

## Building Cross-Platform Images

To build cross-platform images with Docker Buildx, we use the `docker buildx build` command. The key option to note is the `--platform` flag, which allows us to specify the target CPU architectures.

```bash
$ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2 .
```

In the above example, we are building an image that is compatible with both ARM and AMD processors by specifying the desired platforms using the `--platform` flag.

It's important to note that the resulting images will not be visible in the regular `docker images` output. Instead, they are stored in the buildx cache. If you want to directly push the images to Docker Hub, you can use the `--push` flag:

```bash
$ docker buildx build --

platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2 --push .
```

After pushing the images, you can view them on Docker Hub or any other container registry of your choice.

## Inspecting Images and Other Useful Commands

Docker Buildx provides additional commands for inspecting and managing images and builder instances. Here are a few essential commands:

- **docker buildx imagetools inspect**: This command allows you to inspect the details of the created images, such as their names, media types, and associated platforms.

  ```bash
  $ docker buildx imagetools inspect sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2
  Name:      docker.io/sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2
  MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json
  Digest:    sha256:af1c773ab325739067687e2df19137de675b6c7b4d618e6fac0197b55d8136bc

  Manifests:
    Name:      docker.io/sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2@sha256:1b270f007c1645e69e43595f0b5cd7fd06951c2974901943bcc503647b4fb35f
    MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
    Platform:  linux/amd64

    Name:      docker.io/sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2@sha256:4520b7bb8af2c868205524856667aa88ce180d260330aef3a325f69a3f336acb
    MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
    Platform:  linux/arm64

    Name:      docker.io/sunnybhambhani/multi_test:v2@sha256:1f5d06b9181d8e4b5b552f2c5f5f0978d9409aef5233059c3136b469871c5b7f
    MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
    Platform:  linux/arm/v7
  ```

- **docker buildx inspect**: Use this command to inspect the current builder instance, providing detailed information about its configuration.

- **docker buildx prune**: This command allows you to remove the build cache associated with Docker Buildx.

- **docker buildx rm**: Use this command to remove a specific builder instance.

- **docker buildx stop**: This command stops the builder instance.
